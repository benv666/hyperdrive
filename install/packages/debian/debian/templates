Description: Do you want to restart Hyperdrive to apply the update?
  Any running Hyperdrive services need to be restarted in order to apply this update.
  NOTE: this may restart your Validator Clients if a new client version has been released.
  If you have Doppelganger detection enabled, it will trigger and you will miss a few attestations.
  This is normal.
